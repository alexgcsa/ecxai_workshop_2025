## AutoML for Biochemical Property Prediction

This repository contains the code and resources for Evolutionary AutoML for Biochemical Property Prediction. It focuses on interpreting the machine learning pipelines generated by the AutoML method for biochemical property prediction, particularly for ADMET (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity) properties.



## üì¶ Project Structure

```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ datasets/             # Raw and processed datasets for biochemical property prediction
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ grammar/              # The context-free grammar (CFG) describing the AutoML search space in a Backus‚ÄìNaur form (.bnf) file.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ automl_biochem.py     # The Python code implementing the evolutionary AutoML method (i.e., Bayesian Optimisation Algorithm) for biochemical property prediction
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.yml      # Conda environment specification
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md             # Project documentation
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Environment Setup

To set up the project environment using Conda, follow the steps below:

### 1. Create the conda environment

Make sure you have [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) installed.

Then run:

```bash
conda env create -f requirements.yml
```

### 2. Activate the environment

```bash
conda activate automl_biochem
```

### 3. Deactivate the environment (when you're done)

```bash
conda deactivate
```


## üìñ How to use the proposed AutoML method?

After activating automl_biochem environment, run:

```bash
python automl_biochem.py training_file.csv testing_file.csv grammar output_directory
```

E.g., using:

* "datasets/01_caco2_train.csv" as the training file.csv
* "datasets/01_caco2_blindtest.csv" as the testing file.csv
* "grammar/automl.bnf" as the grammar defining the AutoML search space
* "." as the output directory


```bash
python automl_biochem.py datasets/01_caco2_train.csv datasets/01_caco2_blindtest.csv grammar/automl.bnf .
```
